# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio website! This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio, showcasing my projects, skills, and experience.

## Overview

This portfolio website is built using a combination of frontend technologies such as Tailwind CSS and HTML, along with frontend libraries React and Vue.js. The website is powered by Next.js, a React-based framework that provides server-side rendering and other performance optimizations.

The backend of the portfolio is built using Node.js with the Express.js framework, providing a robust and scalable server-side architecture. MongoDB and MySQL are used as the databases to store and manage data for the portfolio projects.

## Features

- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS for a modern and visually appealing layout
- Integration with React and Vue.js for dynamic and interactive components
- Server-side rendering and performance optimizations with Next.js
- RESTful API endpoints built with Express.js for handling backend logic
- MongoDB and MySQL databases for storing project data and user information
